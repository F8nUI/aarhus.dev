> Please join our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/swiftdevelopersaarhus/shared_invite/zt-245acml44-Hu3DA4oAl6YgysItmDDVMw) to join discussions about Swift or about planning our future meetups. :-)

This group is for Swift developers in Aarhus who are interested in exploring the intersection of technology and society through discussions and presentations focused on computer software and the Swift Package Manager. 
Join us to network with like-minded individuals, share knowledge, and collaborate on projects that utilize these cutting-edge tools. Whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting out with Swift development, you're welcome to join us and learn and grow together in a supportive and engaging environment. 
Let's push the boundaries of what is possible with Swift and make a positive impact on society through our work.

Organizer and founder: Morten Bek Ditlevsen
