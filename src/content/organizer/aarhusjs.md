## Our code of conduct
All community members, attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers at our meetup must accept the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout all activities surrounding our community and events. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

## Harassment
Our meetup and community are harassment-free environment for everyone.
Please contact the AarhusJS team immediately if you feel harassed, notice anyone being harassed, or have any other concerns.

Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

If someone asks you to stop harassing behavior, you must comply immediately, regardless of who is asking. Failure to comply with a warning to end harassing behavior results in an immediate suspension from participating in any activities related to our meetup community without any refund or reimbursement for any expenses related to participation or sponsorship.

The AarhusJS team is happy to help you contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist you if you experience harassment to feel safe for the duration of the meetup and any future participation in our community. 
We value your safety.

## Sponsors
Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. Sponsors must not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) must not use sexualized clothing, uniforms, costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

## Photos
Photos may be taken by the AarhusJS team, other organizers, speakers, or participants at our events and published on the public internet. Please let the AarhusJS team know before, during, or after an event, if you or someone you know do not want your picture taken or you want your or their picture removed from internet postings due to any circumstance or concern. 
Your person is your property.
