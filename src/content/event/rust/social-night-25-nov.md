## 🍻 Rust Aarhus Social Night – Food, Drinks, and Great Conversations! 🦀

Let’s take a break from the compiler warnings and have some fun at the last meetup of 2025! This month’s Rust meetup is a Social Night - no slides, no talks, just good food, good drinks, and great people.

## 🍔 What to Expect:
We’ll gather at the food hall Markedshallen Nicolinehus, everyone grabs whatever delicious meal or drink they like, and we’ll hang out and chat about Rust, programming, open source, or anything else that sparks conversation.

Whether you’re deep into lifetimes or just curious what Rust is all about, this is the perfect chance to relax, meet other Rustaceans, and connect in a casual setting.

Come hungry, come curious, and come ready to talk code.

Please notice that this is an unsponsored event, meaning that you will have to buy the food and drinks yourself.

## 🦀 All skill levels welcome.

Please check in at our reserved table before buying any food.
You will find a comment on this page around 17:45, to let you know how to find the table.
