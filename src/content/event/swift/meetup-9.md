Join us for the 9th meetup of Swift Developers, Aarhus on Tuesday September 23rd, 2025 at 17:00!

This time we will be at 'Undervisningslokale 1 (U1)' at Dokk1. There's a café at Dokk1 which is open all evening for snacks and beverages.

We said that last meetup was going to be casual. This one will be even more so, as we have no presentations planned. :-)

So come and show off some of the cool things you've made with Swift 6.2, iOS 26, Liquid Glass or something entirely different. :-)
Or just join for the nice chats with nice people who share your interests.

Please contact us if you would like to present at the meetup! :-)
