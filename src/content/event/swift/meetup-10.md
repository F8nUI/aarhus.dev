Our next meetup will be an anniversary, as it will be our 10th meetup. :-)

So come and join us for the 10th meetup of Swift Developers, Aarhus on Monday November 24th, 2025 at 17:00!

We will again be meeting at "Undervisningslokale 1 (U1)" at Dokk1. There's a café at Dokk1 which is open all evening for snacks and beverages.

[Mads Odgaard](https://www.madsodgaard.com) will be giving a presentation, that he recently gave at the Server-Side Swift conference at the beginning of October.
Mads participated in Google Summer of Code on the swift-java bridging effort.

And [Art Lasovsky](https://artlasovsky.com) who works for the Leica camera company will give an presentation about SwiftUI's anchor preferences.

Please contact us if you would like to present at the meetup! :-)
